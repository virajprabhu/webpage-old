I interned at Tonbo Imaging, Bangalore from January-June '15 as my Practice School component of my undergrad course. Tonbo Imaging designs, builds and deploys advanced imaging and sensor systems to sense, understand and control complex environments. It was a great experience with a  small team of passionate employees and gave me considerable exposure across a wide range of topics ranging from embedded development camera calibration techniques. <br/>

For my first project on automated calibration, I designed and implemented an algorithm in MATLAB for automated computation of intrinsic camera parameters such as field of view, focal length and optical centre with high accuracy using an <a href="http://april.eecs.umich.edu/wiki/index.php/AprilTags">AprilTags</a> target and collimator setup. This was required to replace the present system on manual calibration of cameras used in product prototypes using Pan-Tilt Unit's which was tedious, error prone and time consuming. Promising accuracy was observed across a range of zoom values on both color and infrared cameras. <br/>
As my second project, I implemented a boresighting application in embedded C on a DM365 processor, including the worklow of calibrating the muzzle reticule as well as the process of aligning the muzzle with the weapon's sighting system as part of a boresighting product developed by the company.<br/>
