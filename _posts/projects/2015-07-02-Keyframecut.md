As an intern at Adobe Systems, Bangalore from May-July '14, I worked extensively in Computer Vision and allied fields as part of a two member team on developing a feature for real time background removal and substution from video. We finally designed and implemented a novel Grabcut-based segmentation algorithm – ‘Keyframe Cut’ forthat fused color, motion, shape prior and adaptive background cues. <br/>

It was developed in C++ as a feature for the e-learning content authoring tool, Adobe Presenter, and demonstrated promising results under reasonable constraints for the background. <br/>

We also developed a basic prototype of a preview feedback system to automatically identify poor quality backgrounds where our algorithm was likely to fail, so as to warn users to adjust their background accordingly to obtain best results. <br/>
